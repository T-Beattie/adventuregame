A street rat, accustomed to the harsh realities of survival, you've long endured the sting of poverty and the indifference of society.\n\nWhispers drift through the narrow streets of the town. They speak of a path to the north, a route known to lead to the Golden Sun Arch. It's said that through the arch leads to untold riches, hidden away in the depths of some long-forgotten labyrinth.\n\nEach murmur of danger and wealth ignites a spark of adventure deep within you. The mundane existence you've grown accustomed to suddenly feels suffocating, and the allure of wealth beyond imagining is too much to bear.\n\nWith resolve hardening in your heart like steel, you make a decision. Tonight! You are out of here tonight! No more begging for scraps. No more struggling to find places to sleep. That treasure will be yours.\n\nYou leave behind the safety of the town and venture forth into the darkness. Ahead, a long journey north. It is almost light by the time you notice it in the distance.
